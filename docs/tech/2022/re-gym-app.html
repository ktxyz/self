    <h1>Local gym forced me to RE their app</h1>
<h2>or: How to roll-out your own version of an API client in a few simple steps</h2>
<h3>BEWARE</h3>
<h2>This is an old post.</h2>
<p>TLDR; I <em>hacked</em> (wink) my gym's app, so my friend can go with me using his old phone.</p>
<p>After some convincing I managed to get my friends to sign-up to a local gym with me. One of them unfortunately
was unable to use their entrance app on his phone (he has Android 5.0, app requires 6.0+). Customer service told
us that this app is the ONLY way they provide to access the facility. I did not see any technical reason for
this stupid app, that simply generates QR code via their API, to require him to purchase a newer phone. So I
decided to write my own so that he can finally train with me.</p>
<h4><em>DISCLAIMER</em>: this post will be mostly about surface-level overview of how to write your own</h4>
<p>client for some service
with a non-documented API. If you are already experienced with it you won't get much out of this read. The
interesting part is that my client actually has to be tested physically at their location.</p>
<hr />
<h2>1. How API clients "work"</h2>
<p>Before we start with anything concrete let's quickly go over how an API is typically consumed. A simplified model
looks like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>(Most) APIs provide a <em>login</em> endpoint where clients send requests (<a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cics-ts/5.3?topic=protocol-http-requests">What are requests?</a>) with
   authentication (typically username/email and password)
   data and receive some form of (<a href="https://www.okta.com/identity-101/what-is-token-based-authentication/">What are tokens?</a>) authentication token in a response.</li>
<li>Clients save this token and from this point on use it to request data from API's other endpoints.</li>
<li>API understands only the requests it receives. It doesn't care about the actual place they come from. So, if
   you just happen to have the correct authentication token <strong>and</strong> send requests in the same way as the
   official client (exactly the same way, more on this later), you are pretty much indistinguishable from the "official"
   client.</li>
</ol>
<p>So with that in mind, we just have to figure out what requests the official client makes to the server, and
mirror them. For a <em>public</em> API it's very straightforward as they are well-documented with lots of
resources on how to use them. But for a <em>private</em> API things get a little bit harder, since we have to read
how the API and its requests work by examining the "official" client. And since most of the time when we are
dealing with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software">proprietary software</a>, we don't have access to its source code. And so we have to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_engineering">reverse engineer</a> it ourselves.</p>
<hr />
<h2>2. Reverse engineering for beginners</h2>
<p>With that out of the way, let's start getting into something more concrete. My problem at the start was as
follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have an app on my phone. I can't access its source code but I have to know what it's doing EXACTLY.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Every time a problem like this essentially boils down to looking at the binary's assembly (since reversing
binary to assembly is easy, but assembly to actual code is not). In some cases we are able to get a more
"reading-friendly"
format of the decompiled assembly. Sometimes it can work pretty nicely, but most of the time context is lost
and there's not much to gain from reading the code instead of the instructions. Fortunately for me, Android apps
are written in Java, so we can use <a href="https://github.com/JesusFreke/smali">Smali</a>
disassembly, which then translates pretty nicely into actual Java code using some free tools. (Most helpful was <a href="https://bytecodeviewer.com/">bytecode viewer</a> for the Java code and Android Studio's built-in APK
analyzer for IDE functionality). So before going forward we do have to know how to at least read some assembly
language.</p>
<p>So, we have only the APK (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cityfit.mobile&amp;hl=pl&amp;gl=US">CityFit</a>) downloaded from the store using one of the many free online tools. Our plan is
as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Put our APK into bytecodeviewer and Android Studio</li>
<li>Read the code and study the API requests made from it</li>
<li>(Optional) document and mock the API so that we can test it without any code and not forget about some
   important call later on (I used <a href="https://www.postman.com/">Postman</a> for that)</li>
<li>Recreate requests in our own code.</li>
<li>???????</li>
<li>Profit!!! (In this case, have a friend at the gym)</li>
</ol>
<p>Seems simple enough.</p>

<h2>3. Reading code that is not available for reading</h2>
<h3>APK loaded in the software</h3>

<img alt="img02" src="https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/ktxyz/self/refs/heads/master/docs/_assets/img/2022/re/img-02.png" /></p>
<p>Those screens at the beginning look very intimidating. I had zero experience with any Android development. But I
just did the first thing that popped in my head – looked around some random files. The one thing I knew is that
their code is inside:</p>
<pre><code>/java/com/cityfit/
</code></pre>
<p>folder, and the rest are just 3rd party libraries.</p>
<p>After some time I finally got something interesting:</p>
<p><img alt="img03" src="https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/ktxyz/self/refs/heads/master/docs/_assets/img/2022/re/img-03.png" /></p>
<p>Now I know the API URL. First step forward has been made. No more could I turn back. I felt blood.</p>
<p>Motivated, I dug around for a few hours (like 3 or 4. this whole part of deciphering code was done between
11PM and 4AM) and had a list of interesting files:</p>
<pre><code>/java/com/cityfit/mobile/utils/QRUtilsKT          &lt;- Generating QR code from tokens received from API
/java/com/cityfit/mobile/utils/DeviceIdUtilsKT     &lt;- Generating unique device ID, biggest PIA, cost me 2 testing accounts and around $20
/java/com/cityfit/mobile/presentation/common/utils/DateUtilsKt &lt;- Timestamp used for the QR generation, received from time server using TrueTime library
/java/com/cityfit/mobile/data/api/ClubEntranceApi  &lt;- Shows which endpoint is used to get the data for the QR generation as well as device registration
/java/com/cityfit/mobile/data/api/Api              &lt;- Shows all of the endpoints, but most importantly, the login at &quot;/tokens&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>With this list in mind I proceeded to the next stage. I created a few fake accounts and using logcat and device
emulator inspected what data is being sent and received. Fortunately for me they logged all the data received so
I didn't have to learn how to use <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/">Wireshark</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="img04" src="https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/ktxyz/self/refs/heads/master/docs/_assets/img/2022/re/img-04.png" /></p>
<p>I cross-referenced it with functions in selected files and was able to create an overview of how the
API works:</p>
<ol>
<li>Client sends a request to <code>/tokens</code> with authentication data and receives a Bearer token, which is then used
   for all communication with the API</li>
<li>If the client does not have a device active (which is checked either at <code>/me/barcode</code> OR as an error with QR
   generation, can't remember right now, was not that important for me. Registration itself happens at <code>/me/device</code>)
   it registers the device using device
   ID from the <code>DeviceIdUtilsKT</code> file. It's just the UUID-fied <code>secure.android_id</code> (which, as I later learn, is
   unique for APK SIGNING \:D).</li>
<li>QR is generated using 3 values received from <code>/me/access/permit?mobileDeviceId={registeredDeviceID}</code>. The
   values are: access_token, access_level (? I guess who we are – gym member, staff, owner, tech etc.) and an
   integer. Integer is used to hide any time desynchronization between server and client, since timestamp gets
   divided by it. I've only seen it returned as 15.</li>
<li>QR code generation is <code>/java/com/cityfit/mobile/utils/QRUtilsKT</code>. I was unable to read it from the Smali code
   itself, so I opened it in bytecodeviewer:</li>
</ol>
<p><img alt="img05" src="https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/ktxyz/self/refs/heads/master/docs/_assets/img/2022/re/img-05.png" /></p>
<p>I had to fiddle around and see which decompiler gave the best result, but in the end I was able to decipher
that it simply concatenates the access level with the divided timestamp <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC">HmacSHA1-ed</a>
using the token. I quickly recreated it in some mockup code and tested if I produce the same values as the
client. And I did.</p>
<p><img alt="img06" src="https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/ktxyz/self/refs/heads/master/docs/_assets/img/2022/re/img-06.png" /></p>
<ol>
<li>I mocked the API requests in Postman. I couldn't test the QR generation nor validity, but at least I was
   sure that authentication and registration work as intended. (And that accounts can't be registered on
   devices using different device IDs. The endpoint can't even be re-called using the same ID, otherwise they
   block the account and you have to contact customer service... I learned that the hard way.)</li>
<li>Next step was to create my <a href="https://github.com/ktxyz/cityfit-light">own app</a> (I DO NOT TAKE ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT HAPPENS WITH YOUR ACCOUNT IF YOU USE IT. PROCEED AT YOUR OWN RISK.). I
   won't get into much detail since I
   can't write Android at all. The app
   is probably the worst thing I have created and I will surely rewrite my client as a web-app someday. It was
   rather straightforward. I set it up so that I can either login, or login and register, set up the device ID
   manually so that it matches my main client (which now that I think about it, broke their security measure so
   that multiple people won't use the same account and share the plan) and generates the QR code using
   intervals similar to those in the official client, although I think they regenerate the QR a little more
   often for some reason.</li>
</ol>
<h3>My horrible app</h3>
<p><img alt="img07" src="https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/ktxyz/self/refs/heads/master/docs/_assets/img/2022/re/img-07.png" /></p>
<hr />
<h2>4. The physical test</h2>
<p>And now the most exciting part. I had to go and test it myself at their location. I was pretty nervous but
hopeful. I packed my usual gym bag and headed out.</p>
<p>I got into the building and pulled out my app, with a brand new, single-day plan account. I walked up to the
scanner thingy, placed my phone and... almost cried. Even if my app is correct and generates good QRs it won't
work. Why?</p>
<p><img alt="img08" src="https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/ktxyz/self/refs/heads/master/docs/_assets/img/2022/re/img-08.png" /></p>
<p>Because of the fucking scanner itself. It's too short. How could I have not thought about it. I mean looking at
the official client we can clearly see that the QR is placed at the top of the screen so that it gets read by the
shallow scanner.</p>
<p><img alt="img09" src="https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/ktxyz/self/refs/heads/master/docs/_assets/img/2022/re/img-09.png" /></p>
<p>So I'm standing there, ready to go back home (since I couldn't enter with normal client, because I got my main
account disabled by accident XD). But then, in the time of the greatest despair I got hit with the greatest idea I
had in this entire project. I used my phone's app <em>cleaning</em> animation to make the QR code smaller!!! And IT
FUCKING WORKED.</p>
<p><img alt="img10" src="https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/ktxyz/self/refs/heads/master/docs/_assets/img/2022/re/img-10.png" /></p>
<p>I was so excited I recorded myself leaving if you want some video proof (<a href="https://youtu.be/stvJvkpCl58">YT link</a> if you prefer that). The beeping at the end is not because of my app, I just
left my bag a little too close to the capsule's doors I think.</p>

<h2>5. The point</h2>
<p>This tiny project sure was a lot of fun and I even learned a little bit about Android apps. But I was pretty
much forced to do it. If I didn't create my own client, my friend wouldn't be able to go to the gym with me.
That's fucked up in my opinion. I understand that we can't support old hardware/software forever. But
<a href="https://www.iriss.org.uk/resources/esss-outlines/digital-inclusion-exclusion-and-participation">digital exclusion</a>, especially one without merit (and since I was able to get inside the
gym I proved that the app did not in fact need the higher API requirement), leads to situations like this. I was
forced to dive into an unknown app and essentially reverse-engineer how it works. That led to me creating my own
app which I think can be used to share a gym membership. Either because of laziness or some weird higher-up
decision developers created a well-known situation – they FORCED someone to break their system. And I do not want
to have to do that. I want my friend to be able to visit the fucking gym with his 5.0 Android phone.</p>
<p>If this somehow gets to someone connected with the gym or the app, they will probably try to mitigate it,
unfortunately for me and my friend. Fortunately for me, there isn't much that they can do, except for swapping
the generation algorithm from time to time, so that I have to go inside the source code every time they push an
update. This leads me to another problem. I wrote this damn app. I could just tell them about it and we could
work out perhaps an official lightweight version of the app or a website (since I could actually help with
coding it). But I can't trust them and I know they won't give a damn about this situation, they'll just try to
block me. If they gave a damn, they would not have excluded \~8% of Android users from accessing their gym
without a reason.</p>
<p>I am not a fan of this situation.</p>
<p>Oh, and they will probably cancel my membership and block me, if they ever find out. Heh.</p>
